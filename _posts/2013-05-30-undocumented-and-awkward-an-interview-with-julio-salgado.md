But wait, are we talking about the queers or the DREAMers? In this case, it&#8217;s both!</p>
<p>Undocuqueer activist illustrator Julio Salgado discusses his political progression from painting a picture perfect portrait of undocumented students to a framework that recognizes even if your record isn&#8217;t squeaky clean, you don&#8217;t deserve to be deported. <span>Highlights include:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>a date with a gay Latino Republican,</span></li>
<li><span>using art to combat fatphobia and body-hatred,</span></li>
<li><span>and the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of being undocumented in California.</span></li>
