bio: "Matt FX Feldman, 21, was born in Greenwich Village, New York. Matt attended Laguardia High School, where he began writing and producing his own music, entrenched himself in Brooklyn’s then nascent DIY scene, and graduated Senior Class President. After a short stint with college abroad, Matt serendipitously found himself at the helm of the music selection for a television series his own taste had been so influenced by: the UK’s SKINS. Under creator Bryan Elsley’s direct supervision Matt chose an average of 17 songs an episode for 10 episodes of the series’ American adaptation. He is the youngest music supervisor to ever select for a major network TV program. Since Skins, Matt co-founded STRONGBROS, a DJ crew and soon-to-be singles label, and has continued producing his own music, slated for a summer 2013 release."
