The proud daughter of a machinist and massage therapist, Molly is passionate about communication and education, as well as issues affecting working families. When she isn’t working and fretting, Molly enjoys baking and cooking dinner with her roommate, painting her nails, playing with her bunny, and (let’s be honest) wasting time on the Internet.
