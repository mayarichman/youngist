excerpt: The contributor bio for Jafe Paulin
bio: "Jafe Paulino comes from a family of musicians whose mission have been to share the sounds and culture of Afro-Caribbean music. By the age of 10 he was performing around New York City public schools and colleges with the family band, demonstrating the practice of old Africa traditions in the new world. As he entered High School, Jafe went on to excel in Beacon High School’s music program. These learning experiences and dedication to multiple instruments cultivated in the pursuit of Jafe’s own rock/reggae/fusion outfit called VIVA MAYDAY, whose music has received much praise from the likes of The Source Magazine and Channel One News. Jafe currently resides in Harlem, NY."
