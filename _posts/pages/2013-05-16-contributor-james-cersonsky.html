bio: "James Cersonsky is a 23-year old writer, youth media organizer, and former labor organizer. He lives in New York, but treks out to New Haven and Philly when he can. Students and young people, he says, should have a common space for spreading media and telling their own storiesâ€”which are too often told for them. Youngist is the place! 
You can follow him on twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/cersonsky'>@Cersonsky</a>."
