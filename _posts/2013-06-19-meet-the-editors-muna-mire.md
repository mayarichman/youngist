<p><span><strong>Who are you?Â </strong></span></p>
<p><span>My name is Muna Mire, my pronouns are she/her/hers they/them/theirs. I&#8217;m a student journalist. Nice to meet you!</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Where are you based? Where are you from?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>I&#8217;m based in Toronto right now which is where I am originally from, so things have sort of come full circle for me. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Whats your favorite thing about the place that you live? What about where you are from? </span></strong></p>
<p><span>My favourite thing about Toronto is the culture of the city. It&#8217;s constantly surprising me by reinventing itself in really interesting ways.</span></p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p><span><strong>Where did you go to school (high school and college, if applicable)? What is your experience with educational institutions?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>I attended high school with Hira, actually. We went to high school in the Deep South, aka metro Atlanta, aka in the middle of nowhere. Toronto has been quite a change of pace for me. My experience with educational institutions has been &#8230; contradictory. I find them profoundly alienating as a woman of color but I am also confronted with the idea that education is really important to the project of bettering myself. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>How did you get involved with Youngist?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I knew a friend who was already involved (Hira) and I met Isabelle through her, not even intending to get involved with Youngist but wanting to connect with other cool folks. I knew that Youngist was coming along and when I finally got around to checking it out, I was so impressed that *I* approached Isabelle about getting more involved.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>How would you describe the current &#8220;online mediascape&#8221;? Where do you think young people (15-30) should get their news and analysis?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The current online mediascape is really diverse, so I&#8217;m not sure if I can succinctly describe it. I would venture that it is very much about streamlined, niche content these days. Young people seem to get their news and analysis from a few key places (at least young people clued into news and analysis) that are primarily run by older stakeholders. I&#8217;m not going to tell anyone where to get their news but I think the idea of young people-powered media is very compelling.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>How, if at all, do you think social media can be used as a tool in grassroots organizing?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>I&#8217;ve seen social media (and Twitter in particular) recently deployed to great success in holding institutions be they governments, corporations, political advocacy or nongovernmental organizations, or even the media, accountable. I also think social media is very useful in promoting fundraising initiatives.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>What do you hope to be able to accomplish through Youngist for our first year?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>I hope to be able to bring together a well-rounded collective of voices through my editorial work with Youngist. Aside from establishing a global contributor base, I hope to be able to bring my own voice to the table on a number of issues.</span></p>
