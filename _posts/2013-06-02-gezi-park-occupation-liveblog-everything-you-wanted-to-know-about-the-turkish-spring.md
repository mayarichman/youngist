<p class="p1"><strong>UPDATE (June 3, 12:32 AM):</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span>We have a new piece written by one of the Gezi Park occupiers, Lara Fresko:</span></p>
<p>“This morning the city seemed quiet and rain was falling as if to clean the trees of tear-gas. What seems most hopeful is that such a mobilization was triggered by a will to protect Gezi Parkı. People from all walks of life came to support each other against police brutality and violence. This solidarity in the face of police violence symbolized the materialization of a discontent against neoliberalism and those guarding it. The chants heard during previous nights were filled with rage against the police, the current government and especially the prime minister. They communicated outrage against growing inequality, consuming, painful urban transformation and a total disregard for democratic values of participation.”</p>
